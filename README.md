# Walmart-Sales-Prediction-For-Future-Campaigns

Walmart is one of the largest retailers in the world and it is very important for them to have accurate forecasts for their sales in various departments. Since there can be many factors that can affect the sales for every department, it becomes imperative that we identify the key factors that play a part in driving the sales and use them to develop a model that can help in forecasting the sales with some accuracy.

This project was developed in order to learn how to use different ML algorithms to predict the sales of a Walmart and compare them. For this project, we have used the dataset available from ‘Walmart Store Sales Forecasting’ project that was available on Kaggle. In this dataset, we have weekly sales data for 45 stores and 99 departments for a period of 3 years. In addition, we had store and geography specific information such as store size, unemployment rate, temperature, promotional markdowns etc. Using these factors, we needed to develop a regression model that can forecast the sales and is also computationally efficient and scalable.

The codes are separated in three jupyter notebooks where we first explore the data and decided which characteristics of the dataset will be used for the models. Then, we cleaned the dataset removing the columns with more than 40% of missing values and applied one hot encoding to categorical values. Finally, we built the machine learning algorithms and calculated their accuracy.

Different Algorithms used for prediction are as follows:
1)	Linear Regression
2)	KNN Regressor
3)	Decision Tree Regressor
4)	Random Forest Regressor

The jupyter notebooks are listed below:

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

In conclusion, we predicted the weekly sales using different algorithms which can be used by Walmart to forecast its future sales. They need to focus on the inventory planning of key departments like 38,92 and 95. They need to overhaul the Markdowns that are given currently as they are not having the intended impact on sales. They need to focus on the year-end inventory as week 51 and 52 play a crucial part in predicting sales.
